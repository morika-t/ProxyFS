Need unit tests!

Use Register() interface to create multiple nodes and force the
state transitions.  Here are test cases:

1. 1 up and 2 join
2. 1 of 3 only up and transaction fails
3. 3 of 3 and transaction works
4. split brain scenarios
5. fail transaction because in subcluster
6. find out that local node is dead and panic and catch it

- check failover, offline, whole state diagram
